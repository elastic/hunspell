This is the initial release of the Macedonian Spellchecker (Cyrillic and Latin) add-on for Mozilla applications. 

Both of the wordlists are based on the original Macedonian Wordlist (Cyrillic version) created by Taras Bendik, covered by the GNU GPL License. See dictionaries/ReadMe-mk_MK.txt for more information. 

Both wordlists are:
•	UTF-8 encoded, 
•	sorted in alphabetical order

The wordlists are too long and have words I’ve never heard of, so my plan is to review the lists.
